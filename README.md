A picture viewer to control your HDMI connected HDTV and have fun with it.

This is a cool way to download and view pictures from the internet on to your HDTV with a simple bash program. You can control the room's environment with images downloaded at a set interval and displayed on your HDTV -- and when internet is not available, the program will switch to an offline mode with a quicker viewing interval. Just press control-C at any time to end the program, which will also set your wallpaper to the last viewed images. Future options may use the registered API at source.unsplash.com, et al. This program can easily be adapted to use MySQL for better support, and also to implement a "PowerPoint"-style smart application system. This code was written on a laptop running Linux Debian (Buster). See the bash code for further comments.
